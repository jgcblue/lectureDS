1. **Prepare the DataFrame:**
   Make sure you have your DataFrame ready with two columns containing the data you want to visualize in the scatter plot.

2. **Install Tableau Public:**
   If you haven't already, download and install Tableau Public from the Tableau website (https://public.tableau.com/). It's a free software that allows you to create and share visualizations.

3. **Launch Tableau Public:**
   Open Tableau Public on your computer.

4. **Connect to Your DataFrame:**
   - Click on the "Connect" option in Tableau Public.
   - Choose the file type or location where your DataFrame is stored (e.g., Excel, CSV).
   - Select your DataFrame and import it into Tableau Public.

5. **Build the Scatter Plot:**
   - Drag the first column of your DataFrame (independent variable) to the "Columns" shelf in Tableau Public.
   - Drag the second column of your DataFrame (dependent variable) to the "Rows" shelf in Tableau Public.

6. **Create the Scatter Plot:**
   - Once you have dragged both columns, Tableau will automatically create a scatter plot based on your data.
   - If the plot doesn't appear as a scatter plot, click on the "Show Me" option in the top-right corner of Tableau and choose the scatter plot icon.

7. **Customize the Scatter Plot:**
   - You can customize the appearance of your scatter plot by clicking on different elements of the plot.
   - For example, you can change the color and size of the data points, add labels, modify axes, and so on.

8. **Save and Share the Scatter Plot:**
   - After you have created the scatter plot and customized it to your liking, save your Tableau Public workbook.
   - You can then share the visualization by uploading it to Tableau Public, where you'll get a unique URL to share with others.

9. **Embed the Scatter Plot in Markdown:**
   - To embed the scatter plot in a Markdown file, go to your published Tableau Public visualization.
   - Click on the "Share" button in the top-right corner and select the "Embed Code" option.
   - Copy the embed code provided by Tableau Public and paste it into your Markdown file.
